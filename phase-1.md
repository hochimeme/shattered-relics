# Leagues 3 Phase 1

## Notes

* Start with thieving, fishing, and defence
* Unlocking a combat skill unlocks the corresponding DMM starting weapon
* The first combat stat unlocked doesn't matter too much since you can unlock the second one pretty quickly, though attack and magic seem like the best choices to me
* Don't feel like you need to stick around in the starting area
* There will likely be more tasks than the ones listed here, so be opportunistic

## Starting out

This phase should take about 11 minutes, plus however long it takes to skill and do quests, so approx 20 minutes in total

* [ ] Open the leagues menu
* [ ] Complete the leagues tutorial
* [ ] Get stung by bees
* [ ] Collect 5 flax (drop)
* [ ] Cut down 3 trees (1 to fletch, 1 to burn, 1 for monk's friend)
* [ ] Talk to a banker (withdraw 25 gp)
* [ ] Pickpocket until 10 thieving (6 tasks)

* [ ] Pick wheat (drop)
* [ ] Rake a patch
* [ ] Fletch arrow shafts
* [ ] Catch at least 2 shrimp

  * [ ] Dwellberries (plague city)
* [ ] Minigame teleport to Ferox
* [ ] Buy a beer

### Check-in:

At this point, you should have the following:

* At least 10 thieving
* 27 woodcutting
* 10 agility
* Monk's Friend completed
* 10,000 gp
* 3 ardy tasks
* 2 kandarin tasks
* Ready to complete plague city once you have mining unlocked & snape grass

### Analysis

#### Why woodcutting?

36 Woodcutting is required to do lost city, which can take a while to complete since you're basically locked to a bronze axe. It's also a fairly task-dense skill and unlocks an early afk-able if necessary

#### Why agility?

The grand tree awards a significant amount of agility xp that we can claim once we unlock attack (likely the 3rd or 4th skill). It is also a very task-dense skill and doing rooftops in the next phase will be very helpful

#### Why not x/y/z?

Attack and strength are both really good unlocks at this point as well, but it's good to save them until you have a higher xp multiplier since

1. They're relatively expensive to unlock, and will get easier to unlock once you're deeper into the game and can start completing medium tasks
2. Very few things early game require melee levels

Crafting is a crucial skill and costs 30 points for a reason. Unlocking it right off the bat wouldn't be a bad idea, but I think it's better to wait until you have an ardy cloak 1 before grinding it out. Since fairy rings are hard locked behind crafting (or buying lost city?), you may as well wait until you have a good teleport near one. There's also waystones so transportation isn't a huge problem

Construction has a really strong miniquest called Daddy's Home that gives some construction equipment, teleport tabs, and around level 20 construction (which allows you to move your house to Pollnivneach, which could be useful). Like crafting, it's a really strong unlock and rushing it shouldn't set you back much, but it's expensive and the rewards aren't as strong as they are in the main game due to waystones

#### Before phase 2

If you need a break before starting phase 2, make your way to draynor and run laps around the rooftop course, and work your way up from al kharid to varrock. You can also take some time to chop some oak trees in varrock. This should give you a chance to earn some fragments while planning your next step
